# Flash Talk Notes Project 1

## Group 17
- That's us :)

## Group 18
- [Data Augmentation for Deep Learning-based EEG](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027020303083)

## Group 19
- [Classification of EEG signals using Transformer based deep learning and ensemble models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423005633)
  - Not part of their presentation, but coincidentally encountered: [Efficacy of transformer networks for classification of EEG data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423009217)

## Group 20
- [Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network with EfficientNet-B0 Architecture for Brain Tumor Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10381979)
- Imbalance in number of votes per EEG
- Weigh the number of votes during training

## Group 21
- Look for ensemble baselines that are diverse with good scores
- [Magic Formula to Convert EEG to Spectrograms!](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/discussion/469760)

## Group 22
- 8.7% of spectrograms have missing data and 4.8% of raw EEG files have missing data
- 7.25% of sub-EEGs in *train.csv* are linked to spectrograms with missing values, meaning that 7.25% of the data in the training set is missing.
- There is in imbalance in the labels: there are many spectrograms labeled as "Other".

## Group 23
- [Performance evaluation of EMD, DWT, and WPD for automated epileptic seizure detection and prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809417301544)
  - 4 different machine learning methods: ANN, k-NN, SVM, RF
  - 3 different feature extraction methods: EMD, DWT, WPD
- [Classification of epileptic EEG recordings using signal transforms and convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482519301398)
- Use KerasCV baseline (pinned)
- Feature engineering on the spectrogram
- Planning on extracting WPD features from data and learn a k-NN to the data

## Group 24
- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) measures brain activity during activities to provide insights into cognitive function
- Inference in neuroimaging is the process that helps deduce which part of the brain is active for a given cognitive process
- Reverse inference is the opposite of inference, being a process which helps deduce cognitive processes from brain activity

## Group 25
